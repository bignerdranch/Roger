To do:

- Fix theme support for SDK_INT < 11 in LocalApk
- Improve client feedback 
    - notify when build starts
    - download progress barf
    - notify build errors

Ideas for new features:

- Dependent resource analysis - e.g. why is this deployment taking so long? show resource sizes
- Other resource types:
    - Drawables
    - Styles? No idea how to do this.
- Draw view boundaries
- HierarchyViewer-type stuff
- Running on an emulator (wanted it today)
- Wake up Roger client from background
    - For adb connected devices, this actually would be pretty easy - just send an intent
